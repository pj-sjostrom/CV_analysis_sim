# CV_analysis_sim
Simple simulation of CV analysis in long-term plasticity based on the binomial distribution
- This script runs in Igor Pro, which can be downloaded as a demo version from https://www.wavemetrics.com/support/demos.
- Load the script into Igor Pro. Go into Macros menu and pick 'Set up simulations'. A panel is created.
- Pick the type of simulation in the popup menu 'Pick a simulation'. Simulation will automatically execute.
- Change from long-term depression (LTD) to long-term potentation (LTP) using the checkbox.
- Simulation parameters shown in the bottom part of the panel show the most recent simulation that was run. These parameters are pre-set and cannot be changed without modifying the code.
- Simulation parameters are set to correspond to those in the publication Brock Thomazeau Watanabe Li Sjöström Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience (2020).
